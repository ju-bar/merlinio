1) Calling merlinio

merlinio <input-file-name> [options]

Example:
	merlinio "images\merlin\dataset" -o pacbed.dat -c pacbed_subframe



2) List of command-line options for merlinio

The input file name must follow the program call. Based on this
parameter, the program will access the merlin header file
"<input-file-name>.hdr" and the sequence of merlin data files
"<input-file-name><index>.mib"


-o | -output <string>
	Set the output file name. The output file name will be preset
	with the given string. You may override this by using the
	control command "set_output_file".

-c | -control <string>
	Set the control file name.

/sfh | /scanframeheaders
	Switch to carefully scan all frame headers, leading to longer
	file scan times. Fast scanning will be used when this option
	is omitted.

/debug
	Switch to additional text output.

/silent
	Switch to minimum text output.



3) List of control commands for merlinio

3.1) set command

set_scan_rect_roi
	Sets a rectangular scan region of interest (roi).
	Enter <x0>,<y0>,<x1>,<y1> in the following line to define the
	scan rect roi in by its lower-left and upper-right corner.
	The limiting points are	included in the evaluation.
	By default the program uses the full scan frame. Original
	pixels start with zero index.

set_origin
	Sets the origin of the coordinate system in pixels of
	the detector frame (fractional pixels allowed).
	Enter <x>,<y> in the following line to define the frame
	origin point.

set_sampling
	Sets the components of a linear sampling matrix:
	M = {{xi, xj}, {yi, yj}} translating pixel distances D = (di,dj)
	to another 2d basis with X = M . D or
	x = xi*di + xj*dj
	y = yi*di + yj*dj
	Enter <xi>,<xj>,<yi>,<yj> in the following line to define
	the	sampling rates.

set_annular_range
	Defines minimum and maximum radius of an annular range.
	Enter <r_min>,<r_max> in the following line.

set_output_file
	Sets a new output file name.
	Enter the name string in the following line.

set_defect_mask
	Sets and loads a defect mask images. The mask image is
	expected to contain a series of 32-bit integer values, one
	for each frame pixel. Pixels masked by a value other than
	0 will be replaced by an average estimate from surrounding
	not masked pixels. The replacement will be done after
	gain correction (see below).

set_defect_list
	Sets defects pixels from a text list of coordinates
	loaded from a file. The file name must be provided as
	input string. One pair of x,y coordinats is expected
	in each line of the input file. Pixels listed will be
	replaced by an average estimate from surrounding
	not masked pixels. The replacement will be done after
	gain correction (see below).

set_defect_pixel
	Sets a defect pixel. A pair of <x>,<y> coordinats 
	must be provided as input. The value of the pixel will be
	replaced by an average estimate from surrounding
	not masked pixels. The replacement will be done after
	gain correction (see below).

unset_defect_pixel
	Removes a pixel from the current defect pixel list.
	The coordinates of the pixel to be removed must be given.
	as pair of numbers <x>,<y>.

unset_defect_list
	Deletes the current defect list.

set_gain_correction
	Sets and loads a gain correction factor image. The gain
	correction image is expected to contain a series of 32-bit
	float values, one for each frame pixel. Frame intensities
	will then be multiplied by the pixel gain factors before
	processing the input data further (integration or averaging).

unset_gain_correction
	Stops using gain correction factors.



3.2) operations


extract_frames
	Writes frames of the current scan roi as they are to a new file
	without the headers. The data is not modified. An additional
	text file is written with information about the structure of
	the output.

average_frames
	Averages frames in the current scan roi. Writes 64-bit floating
	point output of an averaged frame to a file using the current
	output file name. Also writes a frame with the standard deviation.
	Two files will be generated with different suffix
	<output-file-name> + "_avg.dat" = average image
	<output-file-name> + "_sdev.dat" = standard deviations

integrate_annular_range
	Integrates an annular range as currently set and for the current
	scan roi. Writes 64-bit floating point output of integrated
	intensities to a file using the current	output file name.

center_of_mass
	Calculates the center of mass contained in the current annular
	range with respect to the current frame origin. Data is extracted
	for the current scan roi and output in 64-bit floating point
	format to files for each calculated component. Three files are
	generated and saved with different name suffix
	<output-file-name> + "_0-0.dat" = reference area integral
	<output-file-name> + "_1-0.dat" = center of mass x component
	<output-file-name> + "_1-1.dat" = center of mass y component
	is added tp 

exit
	Stops command input leading to program exit.


4) Notes

4.1) Gain correction

If set by "set_gain_correction", gain factors will be multiplied to
original pixel values or to sums taken from original pixels and
before any integration operation.

4.2) Defect pixel correction

The program hold a list of defect pixels marked for correction.
You can add pixels to the list by the commands 
"set_defect_mask", "set_defect_list", and "set_defect_pixel".
or remove pixels by the commands
"unset_defect_pixel" and "unset_defect_list" (see above).
Values of pixels listed will be replaced by an average estimate
taken from surrounding not masked pixels. The replacement will
be done after gain correction. The correction will be applied
to original pixel values or to sums taken from original pixels
and before any integration operation.
